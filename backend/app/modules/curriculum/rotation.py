"""Rotation engine — decides which (skill, activity, difficulty) the user
should practice today.

This module is INTENTIONALLY DB-FREE. It takes plain data in, returns plain
data out. No SQLAlchemy. No commits. The service layer fetches the data,
calls into here, and writes the results.

Why? Pure logic is easy to test. Pedagogy rules will evolve — keeping them
out of DB code means we can change them without DB risk.

Inputs:
  - week_number          : 1..duration_weeks
  - day_in_week          : 1..7
  - skill_name_to_id     : {'grammar': 1, 'vocabulary': 2, ...}
  - history_by_skill_id  : {skill_id: last_activity_type or None}

Output:
  - Plan(skill_id, activity_type, target_difficulty)
