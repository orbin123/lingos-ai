"""Speech-to-Text client contract.

Implementation: OpenAI Whisper API (whisper-1).

Used by all speak_* task types: storyboard_narration,
retell_what_you_heard, and any future free-form speaking task.

Why one interface instead of two methods?
The same Whisper call handles both modes — the only difference is
whether `with_timestamps=True` flips the response_format from `json`
to `verbose_json`. Hiding that behind one method keeps callers simple
and lets a future provider (e.g. local Whisper, Deepgram) drop in
without changing call sites.
