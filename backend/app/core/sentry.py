"""Sentry error-tracking integration.

Logging tells us what we *chose* to record; Sentry surfaces the unexpected
exceptions — full stack trace, request context, grouped by fingerprint. This
module owns three things so ``main.py`` stays thin and the filtering logic is
unit-testable:

* :func:`init_sentry` — one-time SDK init, a no-op when ``SENTRY_DSN`` is empty
  (the local/test default), so dev and CI are untouched unless a DSN is set.
* :func:`_before_send` — drops the *expected/recoverable* LLM/TTS/STT/etc.
  errors (timeouts, rate-limits, validation) so the dashboard only shows
  genuine surprises, not the failures we already catch and retry.
* :func:`capture_to_sentry` — for workers that intentionally swallow an
  exception with a warning log: the existing log line stays, and this adds one
  call that forwards the exception to Sentry tagged with the request
  ``trace_id`` so the event links back to the structured logs.

The ``trace_id`` is the same id ``app.ai.llm.eval_context`` already stamps on
every structured log and ``AIRequestLog`` row, so a Sentry event joins the same
correlation timeline.
