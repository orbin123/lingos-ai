  The infrastructure woke; something between the public URL and the app did
  not. Worth checking, in order:

    scripts/azure-status.sh          what is actually up
    az vm run-command invoke -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $VM_NAME \\
      --command-id RunShellScript \\
      --scripts 'docker logs --tail 50 lingosai-backend'

  A persistent 503 with the VM running usually means the container is not
  healthy, so the maintenance marker at /var/lib/lingosai/maintenance was
  never removed. That is normal before the first deployment.
