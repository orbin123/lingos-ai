## 🌍 Overview

**Lingos AI** is an AI-powered English-tutoring platform for non-native speakers who want to improve **career-focused** communication. A learner follows a multi-week curriculum of daily lessons; each lesson is a chat-driven session that flows **teaching → task → evaluation → feedback**.

The platform is built around three ideas that distinguish it from flashcard-style apps:

1. **Diagnosis first.** Before generating work, Lingos AI assesses the learner across seven distinct skill dimensions and finds where they actually struggle.
2. **Adaptive, personalized tasks.** An agent-based AI layer generates writing, speaking, reading, and listening activities tuned to the learner's level, goals, and recurring weaknesses.
3. **Precise, actionable feedback.** Corrections are specific — what was wrong, why, and how to fix it — and a RAG-backed *feedback memory* lets the tutor remember a learner's recurring mistakes across sessions.

Scoring is handled by a **separate deterministic engine** (no LLM) that turns graded activities into per-sub-skill points and a 0–10 dashboard score, so progress is reproducible and explainable.

---

## 💡 Why Lingos AI

## 🧠 The Learning Model

Lingos AI evaluates and trains every learner across **seven core skills**. Each generated task maps to a weighted set of these sub-skills, and the scoring engine distributes points accordingly.

| # | Skill | What it measures |
| :-: | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Grammar & Sentence Construction** | Correctness and structure of sentences |
| 2 | **Vocabulary & Word Choice** | Range, precision, and appropriateness of words |
| 3 | **Pronunciation & Speech Clarity** | Intelligibility and accuracy of spoken sounds |
| 4 | **Fluency & Spontaneity** | Smoothness and ease of unscripted speech |
| 5 | **Thought Organization & Expression** | Logical flow and clarity of ideas |
| 6 | **Listening & Comprehension** | Understanding spoken English in context |
| 7 | **Tone & Social Awareness** | Register, politeness, and situational fit |

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, TanStack Query, Zustand |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, Python 3.11+, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic, managed by `uv` |
| **AI Layer** | OpenAI, LangChain & LangGraph, agent-based orchestration, provider-abstracted LLM/TTS/STT interfaces |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL, Pinecone (vector DB for feedback memory) |
| **Speech** | Azure Speech (pronunciation assessment), OpenAI TTS/STT |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker Compose, AWS, Vercel |
| **Supporting Services** | Redis, Celery, LangSmith (tracing), Sentry (monitoring), Razorpay (billing), Resend (email) |

> **Note on the vector DB:** the codebase targets **Pinecone** in production. The architecture diagram lists "Vector DB" generically — a FAISS adapter can be swapped in via the embeddings interface for fully local development.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The AI layer is **agent-based**: each capability (LLM, TTS, STT, pronunciation, embeddings, image-gen) implements a shared interface, and prompt-driven agents (teacher, evaluator, feedback, planner, task-generator) compose them. Critically, **lesson flow and scoring are deterministic** — the LLM generates and grades content, but it does not decide curriculum order, and it never computes the final score.

**Request flow at a glance**

| Stage | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | Renders the chat-based lesson UI; streams events over WebSocket; manages server/client state |
| **FastAPI Backend** | Auth, session lifecycle, DB writes, transaction boundaries; thin routes → services → repositories |
| **AI Orchestrator** | Turns deterministic session data into structured events; runs teacher/evaluator/feedback agents |
| **LLM Providers** | Generate task content, evaluate answers, and draft feedback (behind a provider abstraction) |
| **Vector DB** | Stores and retrieves "feedback memory" embeddings for RAG-personalized coaching |
| **Scoring Engine** | Pure, deterministic math — converts graded activities into per-skill points (no LLM, no I/O) |

## 🚀 Local Development

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node.js** | 20+ | Frontend runtime |
| **Python** | 3.11+ | Backend runtime |
| **uv** | latest | Python package manager ([install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) |
| **Docker** | latest | Runs Postgres + Redis locally |
| **PostgreSQL** | 16 | Provided via Docker Compose |
| **Redis** | 7 | Provided via Docker Compose |

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/lingos-ai.git
cd lingos-ai
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your values. The backend reads a **single repo-root `.env`**.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Minimum keys to get started:

```env
# Database & cache
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/lingos
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret

# AI providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Observability (optional locally)
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=ls-...      # LangSmith tracing
SENTRY_DSN=                   # leave blank to disable
```

> The full set of supported variables (Azure Speech, Razorpay, Resend email, OTP, Google OAuth, rate limits, etc.) is documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

### 3. Start infrastructure (Postgres + Redis)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Set up and run the backend

```bash
cd backend
uv sync                                       # install dependencies
uv run alembic upgrade head                   # apply migrations
uv run python -m scripts.seed_curriculum      # seed curriculum (idempotent, required)
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload          # API → http://127.0.0.1:8000  (docs at /docs)
```

> **The curriculum seed is required on every fresh environment.** Chat / today-plan APIs return `404` until both the 24-week and 48-week calendars exist. The script is safe to re-run.

### 5. Set up and run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                                   # app → http://localhost:3000
```

### 6. Access the application

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. The frontend talks to the API at `http://localhost:8000` (override with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`).

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker

The bundled `docker-compose.yml` runs the **stateful services** (Postgres + Redis); the apps run on the host for fast hot-reload.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts:

- **`coach_postgres`** — PostgreSQL 16, with a healthcheck and a named volume for persistence
- **`coach_redis`** — Redis 7, used for caching, rate limiting, and Celery's broker

Ports are read from your `.env` (`POSTGRES_PORT`, `REDIS_PORT`). Stop everything with `docker compose down` (add `-v` to also drop the data volumes).

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

CI runs on every pull request via GitHub Actions (`backend`, `frontend`, and `contract` workflows).

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch off main
git checkout -b feature/your-change

# 2. Make changes, then run the relevant checks locally

# Backend
cd backend
uv run ruff check .          # lint
uv run mypy app              # type-check
uv run pytest                # tests

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run test

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe your change"
git push -u origin feature/your-change

# 4. Open a pull request → CI checks run → review → merge
```

| Step | What happens |
| :-: | --- |
| 1 | Branch from `main` |
| 2 | Implement the change |
| 3 | Run lint, type-check, and tests locally |
| 4 | Open a PR |
| 5 | CI runs (lint · types · tests · contract checks) |
| 6 | Review approval → merge to `main` |

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To keep the codebase consistent:

1. **Open an issue** describing the change before large PRs.
2. **Branch from `main`** using a descriptive name (`feature/…`, `fix/…`).
3. **Follow the layering conventions:** keep DB access in repositories, business logic and transaction commits in services, and routes thin. Raise domain exceptions and translate them to HTTP at the route boundary.
4. **When adding a new ORM model**, register it in `app/models.py` and generate an Alembic migration.
5. **When adding a new activity kind**, add an archetype to the scoring registry *and* a contract row — the app fails at import if they fall out of sync.
6. **Run all checks** (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`) before opening a PR.
7. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR, with a clear description.

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for a deeper tour of the architecture and conventions.
